More questions:

Is there a method for guessing solution to an ODE?
Is there a method for solving integrals in closed form?
Finding a solution to an ODE is nothing other than finding an integral in closed form.
Answer: No.

Whats the difference between a positive definate function and a positive semi definate function
    Semi definate have multiple zeros. Positive function, all values are positive. definate function, there is only one zero. Semi definate function, there are multiple definations.

ODEs: there are rigid definitions
Frames: there are rigit definitions
