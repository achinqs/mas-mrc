      "1. What are some advantages of modelling a system in the time domain vs. the frequency domain?<br><br>\n",
      "Some functions are easier in their respective domains. Convolution in the time domain is multiplication in the frequency domain. Multiple functions can be combined (added or super imposed) in the time domain but they can be seperated into their frequency components and the information is seperable in the frequency domain. In the frequency domain the stability and transient response is quickly available. The time domain approach has the advantage that it can be applied to non Linear Time Invarient systems.<br><br>\n",
      "2. Name two additional forms on how to represent a system in state space form, apart from the Controllable Canonical Form. Give reasons as to why you would pick each form and *briefly* describe their structure, i.e. how to obtain them.<br><br>\n",
      "i. Observable Canonical Form: <br>The Observable Canonical Form guarentees an 'Observable' system. Every state will have some effect on the output and therefor ever state/transition is detectable, the system can not move from one state to another without in some way effecting the output.<br>\n",
      "ii. Cascade Form / Parallel Form:<br>The Cascade or Parallel forms refer to how the system is represented in a block diagram. They are non canonical forms, but can be preferred depending on how the system is being implemented, or how the system being modelled is. <br>\n",
      "<br><br>\n",
      "3. Assume you have a linear algebra package installed on your computer and a system model in state space, i.e. the matrices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. How can you quickly obtain the poles of said system without converting it back to the frequency domain?<br><br>\n",
      "Very quick, MatLab provides this functionallity through at least 3 different toolboxes (Control Systems Toolbox, System Identification Toolbox and Signal Processing Toolbox).
