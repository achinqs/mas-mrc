On top of each of the pillars, a spherical object is mounted that sends some form of signal that the robot is able to receive. Based on some physical characteristica of the signal, the robot is able to deduce it's distance to the center of each of the spheres (the length of the dotted red lines). Examples could be the signal strength of a WiFi signal, or the time an ultrasonic signal sent by each of the spheres took to be received by the robot. Here are some properties of the arena:"

It might also help to think about how many of the four available signals you need in order to determine the position of the robot.
